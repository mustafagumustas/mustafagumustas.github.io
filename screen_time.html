                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>The "Screen Time of Series" project is a data analysis and visualization project that focuses on
                    analyzing the screen time of different characters in a TV series. The project involves processing
                    facial recognition data to determine the presence of characters in each episode and then visualizing
                    their appearance percentages.</p>
